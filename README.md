## Getting Started

You must first clone the repository to your computer or download the files directly in the GitHub graphical interface

Once you have the project locally on your PC, you must have Node installed

You need to create a .env.local file to use environment variables. To obtain these variables, you must send an email to manuel.rodriguez9120@alumnos.udg.mx requesting this information.

Once the database backup, the services above and the cloned project have been imported, we will enter the following command (as appropriate) to run the project locally

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
