## Getting Started

First you need to clone the repository to your computer or download the files directly in the GitHub graphical interface

Once you have the project locally on your PC, you must have Node and Xampp installed for the mysql and apache services

Then you will have to turn on the mysql and apache services of xampp to import the database backup, once the database backup is imported, in the project you must include or modify the environment variables of the .local.env file so that they match the database credentials

Then in the project console you must enter the following command to run the project, as appropriate

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
